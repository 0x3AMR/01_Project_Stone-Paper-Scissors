# 🎮 Stone-Paper-Scissor Game

## 🎮 About the Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock – Paper – Scissors game where the player competes against the computer.
The player chooses one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer makes a random choice each round.
The choices are then compared according to the game rules, and the winner is determined, or a tie is declared if both choices are the same.

## 🤖 How the Computer Works

The computer relies on random selection for each round, making the outcome unpredictable and adding an element of fun and challenge.

## Screen Color Feature

To enhance the gameplay experience, the screen changes color based on the round result:
 • 🟩 Green → if the player wins
 • 🟥 Red → if the player loses
 • 🟨 Yellow → if there is a tie

These colors provide the player with a quick and clear visual indication of the result

## 🌀 Example of a Round
 1. Player chooses: 🪨 Rock
 2. Computer chooses: ✂️ Scissors (randomly)
 3. Result: Player wins
 4. The screen turns green
